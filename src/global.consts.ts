	"My Wiki is an application which lets users create their own wikis about every subjects they desire, and browse the wikis of other users." +
	" Users can add new topics to their wikis, edit topics, or delete them." +
	" The wikis are saved online, which means that if a user uninstalls the app, none of the wikis they created will be affected." +
	"\n\nNOTICE: Although we enable every user write whatever they want in their wikis without censoring, we still delete spam wikis or wikis with very little content." +
	"\n\nAbout us: We are Adi Mintz and Anatoly Landau, two teenagers from Israel. We aren't very experienced " +
	"in app developing, and this is simply one of our hobbies. By now we have developed only two apps, but we intend " +
	"to develop more in the future. We try to update our apps and maintain them, but this is not always possible since " +
